# Healthcare Network PageRank Analysis

A comprehensive Python implementation of PageRank Algorithm for analyzing healthcare provider networks, identifying influential providers, and assessing risk propagation patterns in healthcare systems.

## Overview

This project analyzes physician referral networks using the PageRank algorithm, building upon research from my MAT 167 (Applied Linear Algebra) final project. This implementation extends my findings into practical healthcare applications.

## Key Capabilities:
- Identify influential healthcare providers
- Model risk propagation through provider networks
- Analyze algorithm performance and convergence
- Generate interactive visualizations and dashboards
